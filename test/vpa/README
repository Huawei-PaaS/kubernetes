1. deploy the example deployment:

kubectl create -f sd_deployment.yaml

2. change the resources of a container: 

./patch_resources.sh dp-test sd2 51 51

This will update the request and limit of the memory of container 'sd2' in deployment 'dp-test' to 51G and 51G. Pod should remain running the whole time without restart.
